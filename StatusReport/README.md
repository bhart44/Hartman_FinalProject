Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your instructor!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have been researching PortMIDI and trying to implement the third party library, which I had a very hard time with over the Thanksgiving break. Now that I have seen the pages in the Audio Programming Book and the code on the class Github, I will have so much more ability to write the code for my project.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not implemented just about anything in actual code yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I was trying to use CMake to build PortMIDI and that was a nightmare. I'm glad to know that it's simpler than that.
